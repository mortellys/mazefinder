"Mazefinder - Simple CLI game"
by mortellys (alex e.)
Goal: Lead your character through a random maze. Simple as. Am sure this has been done before.

This was initially for CS50P's final project, but I'm failing to find working functions that are easily testable with pytest without changing a whole lot.
Will be making another... simpler, non "graphical" project, probably just for CS50P.

Thus:
    [x] 0. Splash screen menu (Press A to Start + Art kinda thing, why not?) <-- Not sure why this was my numero uno priority lol
    [x] 1. Generate the maze randomly
        [x] 1.1 Generate and display the actual maze.
        [x] 1.2 Place exit.
        [x] 1.3 Place player at start of maze gen.
    [x] 2. Player movement and victory condition
    [x] 3. Winning Card + Exit
    -- Extras --
    [ ] 3. Add options
        [ ] 3.1. Maze Size (defaults / max terminal size, manual input (max->termsize~)) as a choice
        [ ] 3.2. Maze Display (Show Generation / Instant Play) as a choice
        [ ] 3.3. Maze Display Gen Speed (min: 1ms, max: 100ms) as an int
        [ ] 3.4. Maze Gen Seed (default: random, manual input) as an int
    [ ] 4. Colors? Perhaps.
    [ ] 5. Profit?

For now, this really isn't meant to be a difficult game, the whole maze is visible
and the path to the exit is also clearly seeable.

‚ö†Ô∏è My interest in this isn't all that high, likely won't "finish it,"
it was mostly to prove myself able to get things done without crutching on following tutorials, etc.
For that, I am proud to have done it mostly. üëè

I warrant there are a lot of things in this code that could be redone more efficiently, no doubt.
Some of the odd choices were me trying to adhere to the CS50P final project requirements (top-level functions w/ unit tests mostly), but ah well.
